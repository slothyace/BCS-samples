# Music
## play-file.json (recommended)
By far the most stable of all music playing related commands. Allows user to attach a music file and it will play it in a VC.<br>
This is also the only offical recommended music playing command by Acedia.<br>
## disconnect.json (optional)
Purges the queue and makes the bot leave the VC.
### Accepts
`.mp3`, `.flac`, `.wav`, `.ogg` and more, but I can't be arsed to test all of them.<br>
Any file format that starts with audio/ will work.
### Rejects
`.m4a` audio files seem to not work.
